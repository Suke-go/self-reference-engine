#Self-Reference Engine
Hi guys, I want to build my life operating system or copilit based on my daily data. With the LLM, I think we can objectively understand my preference, trait, and weak point. Those are easily made with the fact that 'How people use their time' and 'How people feel about that'. This is the project to conbine digital twin and daily reflection.

# what i wanna build
- journaling system with simple interface
- unlocking personal information, preference, or trait. it enhance self-understanding
- use digital twin for decision making or some red-type docs.
I want to make personal copilot, or OS.

## important notes
The big challenges is to support user's motivation to write about their dialy. So, i've decided to make good interface.
First of all, let me write what information is needed for making digital twin.
- their characteristic trait
  -  such as big five
  -  what users wanna be, and those can be elicited from our company's format, but sometimes it is very personal.
- How they use their time
  - Only ok with calendar information, and sometimes we'll provide chance to input addtional information.
  - it's also ok to make tags.
- How they feel bout daily events.
  - labeling
  - small journaling

 This is samely as lifelog journaling, but the user is very lazy i think.


## Business side consideration
- i do think one solution is to set agent type freely
  - such as gamification? i like the idea of 人生はドラゴンクエスト.
- or freemium model bout self-understanding or smg
